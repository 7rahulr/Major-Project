30/09/20, 20:31 - SRM IT Karan: Ma'am this is regarding the college fees for the year 2020-2021. As per the order of Madras High Court, it's stated that colleges can take only 75% of the fees. But we have not been notified about anything regarding fees.
30/09/20, 20:31 - SRM IT Karan: <Media omitted>
30/09/20, 20:31 - SRM IT Karan: The question is that is the college going to notify us about it on future or 'it' has arbitrarily assumed that we are going to pay the full fees. 

Since we have not been using any of thr resources since March, why are we entitled to pay the full fees? 
Kindly help us solve this issue
30/09/20, 20:32 - SRM IT Karan: Ma'am/Sir i have forwaded these as to what our college has decided regarding offline classes and fee refund

30/09/20, 20:34 - SRM IT Karan: While we have our pending issues regarding college fees, exam fee (2nd sem) and the hostel fee too.
30/09/20, 20:35 - SRM IT Karan: No information has been provided by the college to the students regarding late or delay submission of tuition fees
30/09/20, 20:36 - SRM IT Karan: College only replied to those students who emailed regarding fee payment..

Good Morning Ma'am,

27th October would have been Day order 5, if we *did not* have holidays during dussehra.
But today is day order 3, the lab session is for roll no's 31-60(who have already completed the lab test).

So, my doubt is, when and during which slot the test would be conducted for roll no's 1-30.
Will it be on today or during next day order 5.

Sorry to bother you.

01/11/20, 20:00 - SRM IT Digvijay: Maam @919840499674  atleast tell this, so that I can decide whether utilize my time on doing more or downloading first?
01/11/20, 20:01 - +91 98404 99674: See do programs thats what from the beginning i am telling. Tomorrow u can try to download
01/11/20, 20:17 - SRM IT Digvijay: Yes ma'am ,but why I asked this is because when I am downloading the results, some of my previous questions  which were showing 100% have test issues, and I don't want that to happen few hours before the deadline
01/11/20, 20:18 - SRM IT Digvijay: So Im asking a v small question for which u gave a diff answer
01/11/20, 20:18 - SRM IT Saksham: +1

01/11/20, 22:15 - +91 98404 99674: I could not find ur reg nos in the screenshot. Then i can't submit this as the proof.
01/11/20, 22:15 - +91 98404 99674: Take along with the reg no.
01/11/20, 22:17 - SRM IT Sanchita: Ma'am in the mail I have written my registration number. Will that be fine?

01/11/20, 22:40 - SRM IT Kshitij: @919840499674 till today, i had 8 programs per session till 6th session but it's not the same anymore, some of the programs have changed test cases and are not evaluating 100% now and because of that, i cannot download the report. It's not even about a single program but it keeps happening every now and then for me after every 3-5 programs, Ma'am how am i supposed to edit my codes again and again even after they were 100% evaluated. 
You could have conveyed this information before today as well but why is it all happening at the last moment? If you can attend my problem with something which is convenient to my situation then please let me know.
01/11/20, 22:40 - +91 98404 99674: Sure this is fine
01/11/20, 22:40 - SRM IT Digvijay: Thank u maam
01/11/20, 22:42 - SRM IT Karan: I completed 60 programmes before you evaluated the e lab for ct 2 and yesterday when i opened elab i found my programmes to be 56.. Dur to which i lost my marks as more test cases were added.
01/11/20, 22:42 - +91 98404 99674: I will show you the time when i got that msg. When i received the msg immediately i conveyed to you. I can understand your problem. I have the status withvme till ct2.
01/11/20, 22:43 - SRM IT Karan: This thing happened no. Of test cases increased
01/11/20, 22:43 - +91 98404 99674: I will ask the lab coordinator about these issues tomorrow.
01/11/20, 22:43 - SRM IT Karan: Which included 8 programmes in all the required sissions.

02/11/20, 09:42 - SRM IT Digvijay: Good evening sir/maam , as per the latest instructions, the portal for eLab will be closing today at 4 P.M. due to which all the CSE students  (which is over 2k) are trying to access the lab and the server is not coping up. Following are some of the difficulties which we all are facing- 
1. Not able to download the report.
2. Questions that were 100% evaluated are now not getting evaluated again because of some backend changes in the test cases and mandatory conditions.
3. Server is getting down.

Here is a request from all of our section,
Can we just upload the screenshot of our eLab portal homepage which shows the number of questions we have completed in the GCR and then while awarding marks, you can cross-verify. 
This would reduce the traffic from the server and those who are actually trying to complete the questions would be able to do so. It's a humble request to please consider this. It will make the job much easier for both the students as well as all the faculties.

Since the Government of Tamil Nadu has declared holiday on Wednesday, 25th November 2020, the CT3 scheduled for 25th November stands cancelled. The cancelled tests can be scheduled sometime during the first week of December, taking into account the schedule for the university practical Examination.
The online classes for all first year UG and PG programmes are also cancelled for 25th November 2020.

Kindly understand and pratice the problems very well for university exams. I am ready to help you in understanding the problems at anytime.   All the best for ur university exams.

28/11/20, 12:19 - SRM IT Siddhant: Yes ma'am we aren't aware how much to write and end up writing whole explanation and because of that we ran out of time for rest of the questions.
28/11/20, 12:19 - SRM IT Saksham: +1
28/11/20, 12:19 - +91 98404 99674: Sure. I will send it.
28/11/20, 12:20 - SRM IT Siddhant: Thank you ma'am
28/11/20, 12:37 - Anshu: Ma'am we understand this course is of great importance for our future job and placement prospects, but this time it is different. We aren't used to giving online exams with so many questions in limited time. Also, this year is far different from the other years.. this year is a pandemic affected year where everyone is sitting at hom giving online exams, all we expect is we have a seamless experience of exam where we do everything in one place, but MCQ in google form, then google form to get Part B questions, then pdf in mail then images in tinyurl, navigating through all this takes essential time. Needing to solve AVL and red black tree questions for 2 mark questions was very hard for us ma'am. Scanning and uploading the document as well. This time crunch of completing part B in 1 hour was really hard for us to manage.
We kindly request you to be lenient in correcting this paper, as this is a 4 credit subject, losing out on a lot of marks in just one test will have a negative impact on our CGPA. Rest assured, we will give our level best in the university theory exam.

11/12/20, 10:55 - SRM IT Akash Tiwari: Good Observation
11/12/20, 10:56 - DHANUSH: Mam while uploading the snapshot , It shows the uploading file is big , try to retake and I tried about 6 times and its still not uploading
11/12/20, 10:58 - SRM IT Sankalp: +1
11/12/20, 11:01 - SRM IT FA2 Deepanjali: Kindly use Google form circulated by class representative to inform your issues
11/12/20, 11:02 - SRM IT Kamaldeep: https://forms.gle/CXju9d8vczPJR9h8A
this form in which you all can put up all the problem that you face tom during the mock
11/12/20, 11:06 - SRM IT Chetan: even if I met all the conditions as specified earlier through the circular, test got closed automatically before the alloted time
11/12/20, 11:08 - SRM IT Parth: Mam I have completed the test. I didn't want to use my mobile and immediately tell the problems that I faced but now as I have completed the test I can point the problems I faced. The file uploading was the biggest Issue as the webcam photos were not very clear. My webcam is 1080p full hd so if couldn't scan it properly I am sure none of them could have. To get better photos I used my mobile phone. First it showed that browser is not updated (which is not the case my browser is on auto update so if there was an update due it would automatically update it) on trying after a few times I got in. Another problem was clicking pictures through the phone. It kept showing my phone memory is full while I almost have more than 6GB of free memory space. Again on taking the picture multiple times it was getting uploaded. The process took a very long time which I consider a total waste of time which cannot be expected while giving the University exam as there will definitely be a time crunch there.
11/12/20, 14:29 - +91 98404 99674: Ahan sharma, i called you many times to ask about the assignment. But you did not respond. You did not upload any of the assignment. So your assignment marks will be 0 for 10.
11/12/20, 14:30 - +91 98404 99674: 33 and 43 submitted only one assignment. You will not get marks for CLAp4.
11/12/20, 15:17 - +91 98404 99674: Students check ur assignments marks for lab and theory in zoho.
11/12/20, 15:19 - SRM IT Akash Tiwari: Thank you ma'am.

Also this time it was just GK questions what if during my maths paper I want to skip any long numerical for the the end but I can't come back to that again. I can't just keep looking continuously at the same question for 90 minutes in fear of not skipping that.

United Nations and 17 Sustainable Development Goals:

The Sustainable Development Goals are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and improve the lives and prospects of everyone, everywhere. The 17 Goals were adopted by all UN Member States in 2015, as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development which set out a 15-year plan to achieve the Goals.

Today, progress is being made in many places, but, overall, action to meet the Goals is not yet advancing at the speed or scale required. 2020 needs to usher in a decade of ambitious action to deliver the Goals by 2030.

18/05/21, 15:39 - +91 83680 46211: What do we have to do ... ??
18/05/21, 15:40 - DHANUSH: Sir we faced alot of issues today and it was way more pressure on us that we couldn't even solve the Questions we knew.. 
1. Server was very much slow that it was loading only for like 2 mins for each question
2.d we didn't have option to go to particular Question like from 1 to 7 Directly
3. We couldn't see which Questions we did which we left
4. In part A solving questions were also there which were taking time more than a min 
5. In between exam it was hanging again and again
6. In part b Questions were lengthy also it took more time 1 hour wasn't sufficient
Hence with due respect we request to you please do something on this sir ct3 has a very good weightage and in end sem if this happens we may not even be able to solve the Questions we know..
18/05/21, 15:40 - SRM IT Siddhant: Wait for getting low grades. 🥲
18/05/21, 15:41 - SRM IT Chetan: Even if you are saved from corona, SRM is waiting for you

18/05/21, 15:43 - SRM IT Chetan: Sir, free tier of heroku servers are better than the codetantra servers which SRM considers to be the best in the world
18/05/21, 15:44 - SRM IT Subhash: Sir, when the test crossed last 20 mins, the time to load next question was going between (5-40) seconds, and we were not provided with a question map(showing every question number is marked or not). If we want to attend a question near the beginning, we have to come across all the questions we have completed, missing the jump to option was a big fault. When we tried going across all questions , the loading time was more, even the internet connection was stable and with good speed. This is a big injustice sir. Please help us, at least please make sure this doesn't happening for other exams... We can understand the situation of the faculty advisor, but what happened today was the fault of exam department, if you can do something from your side, please help...

11/06/21, 16:03 - DHANUSH: Sir there were a number of issues faced by students in today's PQT exam and they were :- 
1. Questions were very tough
2. Time limit for the questions was not adequate and most (99%) of the students left more than 10-15 questions 
3. It's the end sems and this will greatly affect our gpa .
4. It was a min 3 hour paper as the 2 markers were big sums.
We request you to look into this matter urgently and forward it to the concerned authorities and thereby coming to a solution on what it is to be done as our entire semester GPA stands on this
Thank you

31/07/21, 10:07 - SRM 3rd Yr Fa Gayathri Ma'am: Greetings from CIDC

It gives me immense pleasure to inform you that CIDC has initiated a National Level Internship Program (NLIP) in accordance to the MoU with ECI and AICTE for cultivating fresh engineers for industry ready roles. The initiative has become imperative as AICTE has mandated compulsory internship training for all engineering students from 2017-18 batch, but the required ecosystem to cater for this is still to be developed.

Under this program, CIDC would be assisting various AICTE approved Engineering Colleges and Universities, that have signed MoUs with CIDC, and interested individual students, in securing exposure of practices and processes adopted in Indian Industry.

Such assistance would include conducting lectures, both physical as well as online, and physical site visits, both short term (1-2 days), as well as site deputations ranging between 1 to 6 months.

With this letter we would like to apprise you of this important nation building initiative and seek your indulgence in this initiative by way of participating in lectures to guide students, and allowing students to undertake internships at your plants/sites. A line of confirmation along with possibilities of your participation in one or more of these activities would be quite helpful and therefore requested.
31/07/21, 10:07 - SRM 3rd Yr Fa Gayathri Ma'am: Dear Colleagues,
The various scholarship schemes are open on the student portal of E-Varsity, for the fresh / renewal of scholarships, for the AY 2021-2022.  The last date for applying is 5:00 PM (SRMIST server time) on 15/08/2021.

Please note that whatever minimum criteria that are fixed for a scholarship is only for the eligibility to apply. Satisfying the minimum criteria doesn't mean that the student must get the scholarship. As you are all aware, scholarships are awarded on a highly competitive basis and only for the highly deserving students. The threshold / cut-off CGPA will be decided by the scholarship committee based on the academic credentials of all the students who have applied for a particular category of scholarship.  Applications without proper supporting documents, wherever needed, will be summarily rejected. The decision of the scholarship committee is final and binding.
31/07/21, 10:07 - SRM 3rd Yr Fa Gayathri Ma'am: Dear All

21/09/21, 14:18 - SRM IT Venkat Sai: @919629938751  Ma'am

Is this true
21/09/21, 14:18 - SRM IT Venkat Sai: Pls confirm
21/09/21, 16:00 - SRM 3rd Yr Fa Gayathri Ma'am: We didn't get any information regarding this
21/09/21, 16:01 - SRM IT Venkat Sai: Ok ma'am
22/09/21, 09:38 - SRM 3rd Yr Fa Gayathri Ma'am: Dear Colleagues,
Kindly refer to our earlier communication sent to the students and faculty members, on 2nd September 2021, in respect of reopening of college after Tamil Nadu Government permitted all universities to open the college.
In accordance with the communication, the majority of the Second year students have turned up and physical classes are going in full swing. 
As you are aware, the Final Year students did not have the opportunity to get hands-on experience in the laboratory for almost 3 semesters and with limited practical knowledge they may find it very difficult to undertake their 8th semester project.  I need not emphasise more that hands-on practice is very essential and critical for any engineering / professional education. Without physically practicing or working on equipment, machines, instruments etc, they may not be treated as an Engineer even though they might hold an engineering degree.

Hence, in order to facilitate all the III year and IV year students to plan their travel and report to the campus to undertake all laboratory practicals and assessments, we have decided to postpone the CT2 for III year and IV year B.Tech students to 25th October 2021. This will also help the students who have gone on internship. Once they report to campus, I advise you to schedule all laboratory classes of the current semester as well as the previous two semesters. Post which, the university practical examinations and end semester theory examinations will be scheduled. Training for campus placement for all III year students will also be planned  when they report to campus.

I also advise all the HoDs and faculty members to plan and complete the syllabus for all theory courses for III and IV year B.Tech, before 20th October 2021.
Request all faculty advisors to educate, counsel and advise all III and IV year students in an appropriate manner and sensitise them on the importance of reporting to campus. You may also inform the parents appropriately.

I am arranging to publish the above communication in the student portal of academia by tomorrow.

Look forward to your support and cooperation in bringing normalcy to the academic activities and the campus life.

06/10/21, 12:59 - SRM IT Chetan: Dear Colleagues,
The cycle Test for I year, III year and IV year B.Tech / B.Des / B.Arch of KTR Campus shall be held  in GCR. The II year B.Tech will be held in pen-paper mode. Students taking tests in online mode must write and upload the answers. Each page of the paper must bear the registration number and signature of the student on the top right corner. Additionally the registration number must be watermarked before converting to pdf for upload.

The question paper pattern and mode of examination (Open book or closed book) shall be decided by the department based on the course requirement. 

The respective  departments shall schedule the tests between 20th October and 2nd November 2021 during the course slots, without any conflict. I recommend that the departments handling common courses shall send their schedule first to the offered departments, based on which the offered departments shall schedule the tests for the remaining courses.

Request all HoDs to ensure that appropriate Covid SOPs are strictly adhered to during the conduct of cycle tests.

The above supersedes the test schedule already circulated by Dr. Nandakumar.

If there are any concerns in the above procedure do let me know quickly, before we communicate to all students and faculty.

Warm Regards,

Prof. T. V. GOPAL Ph.D

A Cyber Security Hackathon is being conducted for the Indian Army by Military College of Telecommunication Engineering, Mhow and Rashtriya Raksha University with ISAC as the Knowledge Partner.

The Hackathon is extended over three months and commenced on1st October this year. The participation is open to engineering students across the country as also to Army personnel. It is expected that 100000 people will participate in this individual participation event in an online mode.

Conducted over three stages, the levels of difficulty will keep increasing through each stage. The final level will also see participants competing with each other in the fields of secure coding and exploitation of software defined radios (SDRs) and will culminate in individuals competing with each other in cyber space with real and simulated threats. The participants will need to devise and execute their strategy to beat others to Capture the Flag.

The event will also host a number of seminars, expert talks and conclaves, to focus on emerging cyber threats in the military domain and the methods of mitigation.

Rashtriya Raksha University, an Institution of National Importance under the Ministry of Home Affairs is executing the Hackathon with its knowledge partners ISAC.

There is a dedicated web portal www.sainya-ranakshetram.in which allows registration and also tracks the conduct of the event. The Indian Event Army is planning to have this as an annual event.

This event is expected to benefit a large number of students to gain experience and get an opportunity to win over INR15,00,000 as prize money.

We hope your institution will take maximum advantage of this event.

01/01/22, 14:04 - SRM 3rd Yr Fa Gayathri Ma'am: <Media omitted>
01/01/22, 14:04 - SRM 3rd Yr Fa Gayathri Ma'am: Dear colleagues, 
Kindly ask the students to adhere to the above instructions..
01/01/22, 14:13 - SRM IT Amal: Maam is the rtpcr compulsory ?
01/01/22, 14:16 - SRM 3rd Yr Fa Gayathri Ma'am: S ma... Just now we got this message.......as a precaution to omicron and covid... They made this compulsory.... Taken 72 hours prior to the reporting date....
01/01/22, 14:18 - SRM IT Amal: Rtpcr karane ko
01/01/22, 14:18 - SRM IT Amal: Annexure 1
01/01/22, 14:18 - SRM IT Amal: Aur covid vaccine certificate
01/01/22, 14:18 - SRM IT Amal: Aur tamil nadu ka epass
01/01/22, 14:18 - SRM IT Amal: Maam apart from this, are we supposed to take anything else ?
01/01/22, 14:45 - SRM IT Himanshu: Even if we are fully vaccinated?
01/01/22, 14:51 - SRM IT Venkat Sai: I guess so.
01/01/22, 15:47 - SRM 3rd Yr Fa Gayathri Ma'am: S ma.... This is the order from tamilnadu government... SOP should be followed strictly
01/01/22, 15:48 - SRM IT Himanshu: Ok ma’am
01/01/22, 15:52 - SRM IT Aaditya no 1: Ma'am is stuffing 10+ people in one lift and operating on 100% class strength part of that SOP or an order from Tamil Nadu Govt.?
01/01/22, 15:54 - SRM IT Saksham: Actually ma’am
01/01/22, 15:56 - SRM IT Dev: No SOP can stop the spread of this omicron if everyone is being called back forcefully, everyone knows that
01/01/22, 16:02 - SRM IT Saksham: Ma’am we are being made to sign a form stating we wishfully want to come to clg, and then 24-48 prior to our flights informing us about RTPCR ,roads and all,getting an undertaking signed states that clg will not be taking an responsibility even after forcing us
01/01/22, 16:04 - SRM IT Dev: My parents have refused to sign it, as it says "we understand the risk and wish to come back". Which is not at all true
01/01/22, 16:04 - SRM IT Aaditya no 1: There's this bold text on academia which reads as:
" *Mode of classes: Physical Only* "

You have made it mandatory & when you are so sure that it's really safe to re-open then why are we required to present an undertaking for enrollment!?
01/01/22, 16:07 - SRM IT Saksham: Signing the undertaking means formally and legally we agree to something that we actually don’t want to do
01/01/22, 16:37 - +91 94573 77012: Ma'am now the cases are increasing and it's the beginning of the third wave. 
I cannot understand why  administration want to reopen the college now. 
Everyone knows that the college has a lot of students and it is almost impossible to prevent the spread even after following the Covid rules. 
They are calling us back on the mandatory basis and are asking for the undertaking which mentions that we want to come back and are responsible for everything, but it is not true as our parents are not even willing to send us back on the campus in this situation. @919629938751
01/01/22, 16:45 - SRM IT Hamdan: Ok
01/01/22, 16:53 - SRM IT Dev: I completely agree
01/01/22, 17:10 - SRM 3rd Yr Fa Gayathri Ma'am: Here in tamilnadu all colleges are allowed to reopen.... If government declares to close then only the colleges will be closed... Second year students were here for three months and we were going to college continuously... We don't find any issues till now... One or two issues bcoz of students mess up.....at some point of time you must attend offline classes ma... There won't be any changes
01/01/22, 17:11 - SRM IT sanyam: Why the undertaking? @919629938751
01/01/22, 17:12 - SRM IT Saksham: Exactly
01/01/22, 17:22 - SRM 3rd Yr Fa Gayathri Ma'am: They even got this undertaking letter from each second year student.......do you want to create mess up?? Or did I give space for you to argue like this?? I can't explain more.... How many times do I have to say??? I don't want you people in trouble......
01/01/22, 18:09 - SRM IT Kamaldeep: @919629938751  maam the re-polling is not working for a few off us

Dear Professor,

 

Greetings from Cognizant!

 

The world of IT is vast, and the right guidance can pave the way for every student to build the foundation of their career. At Cognizant, we believe that sharing experiences can help young talent understand the diverse opportunities waiting at their doorstep, as they transition from college students to working professionals.

 

To add a building block in this transition into working professionals, we would like to begin connect sessions on the topic “Career in IT & Cognizant”. To delve deep into the Cognizant culture, we have an experienced leader, Ganesh Kalyanaraman, SVP and Global Delivery Head – Products & Resources (P&R) who will share his secret to success.

 

He will also share how Cognizant encourages talent from various streams to join, learn, grow and create impact in teams.

 

We hope to see an interactive audience and look forward to a great session!

Greetings!

 

We are thrilled to inform you that our interactive learning platform TCS Launchpad is now live for the upcoming 2023 batch of IT graduates!

 

Please allow me to give you a brief idea of what it means for students: 

 

TCS Launchpad is our exclusive shared skill-development space that features a comprehensive collection of resources to help campus students prepare for their professional debut. It is a community of thousands of talented youngsters aspiring to begin their career at TCS with the right kind of informative assistance which Launchpad provides in the form of carefully designed webinars, challenges, assessment and feedback. Students get the opportunity to work on not just various technologies but also their communication skills and they get to connect with experts. We have invested a lot of our sincere effort in conceptualizing Launchpad just to ensure that the students find themselves ready when it is time for them to make the big move from Campus to Corporate, via a promising career at TCS! 

 

To be more specific, Launchpad prepares young aspirants to do well when they take the TCS National Qualifier Test (NQT) which is the single most crucial step towards scoring a TCS career. We have, in fact, already started accepting TCS NQT registrations and will continue doing so till 29th July 2022. 

 

Students may read more about Launchpad on our official website: https://www.tcs.com/careers/tcs-launchpad

Process: PPT.
Date & Time: 21.06.2022(Today) & 04:30 pm.
Mode: Virtual.

Kind Attention:
Dear Coordinator,

Kindly inform the student about PPT and make sure that all the students attend the same. During the PPT session, students get to know all about the companies, their recruitment process, and the salaries they can expect. After the presentations, students are allowed to ask questions to the representatives. 

Thus, I once again request all the coordinators to inform and guide the student accordingly. Because they might not know the importance of a PPT session. Especially, in the TCS process student taking part in the PPT alone will be allowed to take the online test.

NOTE: IT IS MANDATORY FOR ALL STUDENTS TO ATTEND THE PPT. STUDENTS WHO ARE ATTENDING THE PPT ONLY WILL BE RECEIVING THE ONLINE TEST SCHEDULE TO THEIR REGISTERED MAIL ID.

Regards,
Placement Office

PFB the mail from TCS, which is self explanatory.  If students face clash between TCS test and Cognizant communication round on 20.08.2022, students have to take Cognizant only.

The schedule list received from TCS is also attached for your reference.Greetings from TCS Campus Recruitment Team!!

 

Please find attached the list of students who will be taking up the TCS NQT Test Process.

 

For those who have preferred In-center, the test is planned across two shifts on the given date and all the students must report at the test center on or before the reporting time mentioned in the Hall Ticket. Any delay here could result in the candidate losing out on the opportunity.

 

For those who have chosen the remote process must mandatorily login an hour prior to the test shift time and in case a candidate faces any issue, the ONLY way to get it addressed is through the Live Chat option on the screen.

 

Kindly note, the Live Chat option is available in the home page of the application itself and candidate may communicate directly with iON representatives even before logging in.

 

All candidates must be advised against capturing photographs of the test screen even to share with us as this may lead to the iON system flagging off the candidate as ‘Indulging in Unfair Means’.
If any candidate raises an issue of not receiving the Hall Ticket, kindly first check with the final list of registered candidates that was sent by our team.

 If the name of the candidate is in the file, but has still not received the Hall Ticket, then kindly put a mail to us and we will look into it.
Kindly cascade the information to the students to be prepared for the test process.

All premium companies working in the domain of AI/ML are expected to participate in the Expo. A poster presentation session for student projects is also arranged during the event. Brilliant students who have done exceptionally good student-project in AI/ML may please be recommended to participate in the Expo. If their work catches the eye of companies delivering AI/ML solutions, then they might stand to get a direct job offer.

The three-day meet would expose students to various talks by experts in the domain. Please do recommend only those who have reasonably good project to present.
The poster for the event is attached herewith. Students may be asked to register their names in advance at the registration link provided at https://ihub-data.iiit.ac.in/programs/events/

  Cyber Arangam, Tamil Nadu Police  Crime branch wing is excited to announce its very own Hackathon to encourage the students to use their logical and/or coding skills to solve core policing problems. With increasing reliance on technologies while on the one hand prevalence of cybercrimes has increased on the other hand technology has transformed the way things are done. With the aim of using technology to boost police efficiency and to use technological advancements to augment conventional ways of detecting crimes, Tamil Nadu police urge all Tamil Nadu students to enthusiastically participate in the event and contribute to the service of the people and nation-building. 

 

 Hackathon is being organized as a partnership between Police and students who can use their innovative thinking, technical know-how, and enthusiasm for building digital solutions for effective policing and assuring civil safety. Though the Hackathon is being organized in a competitive format, it is in fact the first step in the partnership of socially responsible students with law enforcement agencies in building a safe and secure society. All Tamil Nadu students are invited regardless of the field they are pursuing to participate in this endeavour to ensure safety in society through technological solutions for crime detection and prevention.

 

We request each college to nominate 2 best teams to participate.

30/12/22, 09:25 - SRM 3rd Yr Fa Gayathri Ma'am: Dear Colleagues, 

With regard to the subject mentioned, students of every department of all the Faculty of our SRM Institute of Science and Technology across all the campuses are to be instructed to open an “Academic Bank of Credits (ABC)” and get their unique ID for the purpose to offer seamless student mobility between or within degree-granting Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) through a formal system of credit recognition, credit accumulation, credit transfers, and credit redemption. ABC can promote and facilitate inter-institutional partnerships.



Benefits: ABC offers learners greater choice and flexibility in choosing courses and institutions, allowing a liberal mix of educational programmes that are vocational, academic, and more. A student can avail of multiple entries and exit options in higher education institutions and opt for a tailor-made degree. They can choose to study one course a year in one institution and switch to another one the next year. 



          Therefore, all Deans and Directors are requested to instruct their respective department heads to instruct their students to create ABC Unique IDs (the guideline for opening a student ABC account is attached herewith). Ensure all students enter the same through the SRM IST student portal [https://evarsity.srmist.edu.in/srmsip] under the updates menu and ask them to complete the same on or before 04.01.2023.

          

For the benefit of the student, the guideline to open an ABC account is attached to this.

04/01/23, 09:12 - SRM 3rd Yr Fa Gayathri Ma'am: Dear Student,

We (SRMIST) have requested an international ranking agency, QS-Igauge, to assess the systems and processes and give suggestions for improvements. QS will also give a rating grade like ‘Diamond Grade’ or 'Platinum Grade' which will help us to bring more companies for placement at high salaries. Further having an IGAUGE rated stamp will enable you to get better overseas opportunities. It will also improve our global and national rankings.

As a part of the process QS will conduct a survey among you. Your responses will directly go to QS and your identity will not be disclosed.  

Hence, we request you to click on the following link (or copy the url and paste in the browser) and give your responses to the survey. It will take 5-7 minutes of your time. Based on your responses QS will give SRM a rating as mentioned above.

We seek your cooperation in responding in large numbers so that the number of responses becomes more than the target fixed by QS.

The link is given below:

03/02/23, 21:51 - SRM 3rd Yr Fa Gayathri Ma'am: Dear Student,

Greetings from SRM Institute of Science and Technology!

For the last few years, you have been providing your valuable feedback on the academic quality at SRMIST through the Students Satisfaction Survey, popularly known as SSS. Your honest response enables us to improve constantly and continuously the quality of academics including teaching, evaluation, outcomes etc.

For the  academic year 2021-22 ending on 30.6.2022 we need your opinion on 27 areas. Kindly take some time off your hectic academic schedule and answer the questionnaire.

National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) a governmental body will also take a similar survey to assess our SRMIST and use the feedback thus obtained as one of the components for awarding Grades to SRMIST. Currently we hold the highest Grade of A++. 

Holding the highest grade enhances our institute’s reputation; attracts a large number of companies for campus recruitment; increases the average salary package; enables smooth admission in institutions abroad; and ensures global recognition and ranking.


The link for the survey is:
https://forms.gle/XdLtq6YtsX5S7ovn6

It will hardly take 5-10 minutes for you  to complete it. Please complete it before 10 Feb. 2023

Thank you in advance 

With warm regards,


Prof. G. Augustine Maniraj Pandian, B.E (Civil), M.Tech (Structures - IIT-D), FIE
